							<p>Skiathos Town is the center/heart of Skiathos and so any accommodation close to the town itself is recommended.<br>Megali Ammos is the closest beach to the town and has some great accommodation options.</p>
              <p>The "Old Town" is also very close to the town itself and is where many of the locals live (including my mother!). Winding streets, blue and white buildings and traditional "Greek" scenes are plentiful.
		          <p>You'll be able to find accommodation further away from the town itself, but if you were to choose this option, we would recommend hiring a car.<br>Accommodation prices can vary depending on where you stay. A few options are listed below. However, definitely explore air bnb and google for further suggestions to suit your needs.</p>
              <p>Aphrodite Studios - basic, self-catering accommodation in a great location – right on the beach! <br/> <a href="http://www.aphroditeskiathos.com/" target="_blank">www.aphroditeskiathos.com</a> </p>
              <p>Studio Lena - self-catering accommodation perfectly situated in the old town. It has a beautiful roof top terrace with amazing views. <br/> <a href="http://www.studioslena.com/" target="_blank">www.studioslena.com</a></p>
              <p>Skiathos Houses - a website of many different 'house' and 'villa' property listing to rent. 'Houses' seem to be smaller places to rent in the town, while 'Villas' are big places with many bedrooms around the island. <br/> <a href="http://skiathosluxuryvillas.com/" target="_blank">skiathosluxuryvillas.com</a></p>

              <h5> FLIGHTS TO SKIATHOS</h5>
							<p>The airport of Skiathos island is located 3 km from the town, on the eastern side of the island. It receives regular internal flights from Athens all year round and the flight time is 30 min. In summer, it also receives many charters and international flights from abroad.</p>
              <h5>FERRIES TO SKIATHOS</h5>
              <p>There is no direct ferry from Athens to Skiathos. Ferries to Skiathos depart from Agios Konstantinos, a port town in central Greece, or from the port of Volos. To go to Agios Konstantinos or Volos from Athens, visitors can take the bus from Liossion KTEL Station (Patrick and I have done this once – it did end up being a long day but it was fun!). There are also ferries to Skiathos from Mantoudi, a small port in nothern Evia, and the trip takes 2 hours.</p>
              <h5>TRANSPORT AROUND THE ISLAND</h5>
              <p>Cars, scooters and quads are easily available on the island and are a great way to get around. They can be hired on a daily/weekly basis. There is also the option of taking a bus to get around - tickets can be purchased on the bus as you board and are around €2 per trip. There are also taxi’s that you can jump into around the island and are typically quite reasonable. At the airport itself, there will be a line of taxi’s for pick-up. The airport is a short distance from the port/town but you’ll want to take a taxi to get your accommodation as it is too long to walk to town from the airport.</p>

							<h5>BEACHES</h5>
              <p>Skiathos has over 60 (!!) sandy beaches which are scattered around the 44km coast line.<br>Our favourites include:<p/>
              <p><b>Kastro</b> <br/>A rustic beach with an equally rustic taverna. To us it is paradise! Easiest to visit by boat.</p>
              <p><b>Lalaria</b> <br/>A gorgeous beach with crystal blue water and surrounded by wild rocks. Patrick likes to swim under the rock cave – it freaks me out! You can only get to this beach by boat.</p>
              <p><b>Koukounaries</b> <br/>A great long beach for water sports and is frequented by swans!</p>
              <p><b>Banana Beach</b> <br/>A real party beach with a fun beach bar and a beach bar club called Baninsta for party nights.</p>
              <p><b>Vromolimnos</b> <br/>This will be where our reception venue will be, so naturally we love it! It’s secluded and sheltered.</p>
              <p><b>Megali Ammos</b> <br/>A long beach with loads of accommodation, tavernas and water sports, close to Skiathos town.</p>
              <p><b>Agia Eleni</b> <br/>An amazing beach for sunsets and a bit of a party!</p>

              <h5>BOAT TOURS</h5>
              <p>Boat tours run daily from the New Port. You won’t miss the various captains advertising their trip! Most leave at around 9/10AM daily. We would recommend going on the trips that include Kastro and Lalaria – our fave beaches! There is also a Mama Mia themed boat trip which takes you to all the sights from the movie. We’ve done it. The sights are amazing but the amount of Abba you hear can be quite intense! Not for the faint hearted.</p>

              <h5>Water Sports</h5>
              <p>available on most beaches.</p>

              <h5>QUAD BIKING</h5>
              <p>Quad biking is a fun way to see the island. Two on a quad. With a map. We do it every time we visit the island and always end up exploring a new place.</p>

              <h5>TAVERNAS</h5>
              <p>Soak up the Greek ambience at a traditional taverna – all over the island and the best places to eat traditional Greek food. They serve everything from gavros (small fried fish) to tasty octopus. If a taverna says “Ouzeria” on the outside, they will give you “free” tapas with your drinks.</p>
              <p>For the best "gyro on a pita" in town, try No Name next to Papadiamantis street.</p>

              <h5>EVANGELISTRIA MONASTERY</h5>
              <p>Evangelistria Monastery is a beautiful monastery inhabited by monks. Worth a visit for it’s beauty, tranquillity and moonshine made by the monks.</p>

              <h5>MAMA MIA OPEN AIR THEATER</h5>
              <p>Mama Mia is shown at an open air theater in the center of town. An absolute must and a fun night for all!</p>

							<h6>Boat Trip</h6>
              <p>10 am - 5:00 pm, Tuesday 10th July</p>
              <p>There is a great boat trip around the island, which takes you to various beaches and sights, including a stop off for lunch. We love doing this trip and are planning to do this on the Tuesday before the wedding.
                If you'd like to join, please ensure you buy a ticket prior to the day and arrive for a prompt departure at 10 am.
                The boat, Margarita, departs from the Old Port, see picture below. This is also where you purchase your ticket from.
                Make sure it is from the boat Margarita as there are many boats that leave from the area. </p>
